<!-- PROMPT_VERSION: PROMPT2.1 -->
Create a complete HTML file that enhances a video player with systematic AI-powered frame analysis:

FOUNDATION FEATURES:
1. Professional video player with file upload (build on video player concepts)
2. Debug logging system with comprehensive event tracking
3. Clean, responsive interface using Tailwind CSS

NEW AI ANALYSIS FEATURES:
4. "Analyze Video" button that initiates systematic frame-by-frame processing
5. Automatic video pause during analysis to ensure precise frame capture
6. Sequential processing: seek to 0s, 5s, 10s, 15s, etc. until video end
7. Canvas API integration to capture exact video frames at each timestamp
8. Gemini API integration to analyze each captured frame
9. Built-in AI prompt: "Describe what you see in this video frame. Be objective and factual."

VISUAL TRANSPARENCY SYSTEM:
10. Display each captured frame as a thumbnail image alongside its AI description
11. Show timestamp, frame preview, and AI-generated text for each analysis
12. Scrollable results area showing complete analysis history
13. Users can verify AI accuracy by comparing thumbnails to descriptions

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
14. JavaScript classes for organization: VideoPlayer, FrameAnalyzer, APIManager
15. Proper async/await patterns for API calls and video seeking
16. Sequential processing: wait for each API response before capturing next frame
17. Comprehensive error handling for API failures, video issues, rate limiting
18. Status indicators: ready/analyzing/complete/error with progress updates
19. API key input field for user credentials
20. Include version identifier: <!-- GENERATED_BY: PROMPT2.1 -->

PROFESSIONAL CODE QUALITY:
21. Clear code comments explaining Canvas API usage and timing coordination
22. Modular architecture suitable for future enhancement
23. Responsive design working on desktop and mobile devices
24. Debug logging for all technical events: frame capture, API calls, errors

Create a complete, working application that demonstrates transparent AI vision analysis.
