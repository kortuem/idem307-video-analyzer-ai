<!-- PROMPT_VERSION: PROMPT3.1 -->
Please enhance this existing video analyzer code to add perspective switching functionality:

PRESERVE ALL EXISTING FEATURES:
- Keep complete frame capture and display system
- Maintain visual transparency (thumbnails + descriptions)
- Preserve debug logging and error handling
- Maintain responsive design and professional appearance

ADD PERSPECTIVE SYSTEM:
1. Dropdown menu for selecting analysis perspective before or after analysis:
   - "Objective Description" (current default behavior)
   - "Urban Planning Analysis"
   - "Social Dynamics Analysis" 
   - "Safety Assessment"
   - "Accessibility Review"
   - "Creative Fiction (First-Person Story)"

2. Modify AI prompts based on selected perspective:
   - Urban Planning: "Analyze this from an urban planning perspective: traffic flow, pedestrian infrastructure, accessibility features, public space design, and urban functionality"
   - Social Dynamics: "Analyze this from a sociological perspective: social interactions, group behavior, community dynamics, cultural patterns, and interpersonal relationships"
   - Safety Assessment: "Analyze this from a safety perspective: identify potential hazards, risk factors, safety compliance issues, and protective measures"
   - Accessibility Review: "Analyze this from an accessibility perspective: identify barriers, evaluate inclusive design features, assess mobility challenges, and note universal design elements"
   - Creative Fiction: "Pick one person visible in this frame and create a brief, respectful first-person narrative from their perspective. What might they be thinking or experiencing? Label clearly as creative fiction."

3. Re-analysis functionality: "Re-analyze with New Perspective" button that processes previously captured frames with the selected perspective without re-capturing frames

4. Export functionality: "Download Analysis" button creating downloadable text file with:
   - Video filename and analysis timestamp
   - Selected perspective and total frames analyzed
   - Complete frame-by-frame analysis with timestamps
   - Clear labeling for Creative Fiction sections
   - Professional formatting suitable for reports

UPDATE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Change version identifier to: <!-- GENERATED_BY: PROMPT3.1 -->
- Maintain all existing classes and modular architecture
- Add perspective management to existing code structure
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for new interface elements
